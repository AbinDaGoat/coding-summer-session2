"""
This is a sample program, where we explore different concepts in python.

Each instruction in python gets its own line

In order to execute this file / application, you must "run" it --> using PyCharm

Readability is the most important part of writing code!!! (more on this later)

First and foremost, let's discuss the print()

print() is a built-in function (functionality here) that literally just prints whatever is in
between the parens out to the screen (the little output window in the bottom -- the console)
"""

# print("hello world, my name is mo")
# print("this is another print statement")

"""
this is a comment.

comments don't get executed by the runtime system (aka "python")
"""

# this is a single line comment
# single line comments start with a hash and only cover one line

"""
this is a multiline comment
i can just keep hitting enter and i'll be able to write more comments

in python, you can either use single quotes or double quotes, as long as they each have a buddy

this is where the bulk of our "lessons" will also be
"""

"""
this is the same thing as 
"""
'''
this
'''

# print('will this work?') # yes it will

# print("WHATEVER IS HERE GETS PRINTED TO THE SCREEN IN THE CONSOLE")
# print("my name is paul blart mall cop")

"""
Programming is all about style and convention.

Convention is something that the greater Python community (or really any language community) determines as the standard.

Style is something you pick. You like it, and you're comfortable with it. Just as long as it is easy to ready and doesn't
complicate anything, you should come up with your own style.
