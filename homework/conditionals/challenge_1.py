Write a program that asks the user for a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive). Then report to the user the following:

If the number is even or odd
If the number is prime, composite, or neither (which number is neither...?)
Ensure that the user enters a number between 1 and 5 (you can print an error message if they supply an invalid number).
